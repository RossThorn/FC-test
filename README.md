# <img src="images/FCLogo.png" style="height:30px; width:30px;"> Flyover Country Neotoma Visualization Suite (FCNVS)

This repository contains the Flyover Country Neotoma Visualization Suite (FCNVS), a multivariate visualization library currently built on [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/) for integration into the Flyover Country mobile app.

## What is Flyover Country?

[Flyover Country](http://fc.umn.edu/)  is a National Science Foundation funded offline mobile app for geoscience outreach and data discovery. The app exposes interactive geologic maps from Macrostrat.org, fossil localities from Neotomadb.org and Paleobiodb.org, core sample localities from LacCore.org, Wikipedia articles, offline base maps, and the userâ€™s current GPS determined location, altitude, speed, and heading. The app analyzes a given flight path and caches relevant map data and points of interest (POI), and displays these data during the flight, without in flight wifi. By downloading only the data relevant to a particular flightpath, cache sizes remain reasonable, allowing for a robust experience without an internet connection.

The FCNVS will be implemented into future versions of the app.

## Visualization

This FCNVS was deigned to depict large multivariate datasets from the [Neotoma Database](https://www.neotomadb.org/). The suite includes four visualizations to explore Neotoma's pollen data:
* Petal Plots
* Stacked Histograms
* Radar Charts
* Flagpole Diagrams

These visualizations were chosen after conducting a quantitative content analysis on all the visualizations from papers in the [Neotoma Citations Google Scholar page](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=idoixqkAAAAJ&hl=en). The analysis provided insight into extant visualization methods in the field of paleoecology and informed selection of the particular examples included in the suite.
