# Flyover Country Visualization Suite (FCVS) <img src="images/FCLogo.png"/> 

This repository contains the **Flyover Country Visualization Suite (FCVS)**, a multivariate visualization Javascript library currently built on [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/) for integration into the Flyover Country mobile app.

## What is Flyover Country?

[Flyover Country](http://fc.umn.edu/)  is a National Science Foundation funded offline mobile app for geoscience outreach and data discovery. The app exposes interactive geologic maps from Macrostrat.org, fossil localities from Neotomadb.org and Paleobiodb.org, core sample localities from LacCore.org, Wikipedia articles, offline base maps, and the userâ€™s current GPS determined location, altitude, speed, and heading. The app analyzes a given flight path and caches relevant map data and points of interest (POI), and displays these data during the flight, without in flight wifi. By downloading only the data relevant to a particular flightpath, cache sizes remain reasonable, allowing for a robust experience without an internet connection.

The FCVS will be implemented into future versions of the app.

## Multivariate Visualization

The FCVS was deigned to visualize large multivariate datasets from the [Neotoma Database](https://www.neotomadb.org/). Addressing the problem of visualizing these data through a mobile cartographic interface, the suite includes four visualizations to explore Neotoma's pollen data:
* [Petal Plots](#petal-plot)
* [Stacked Bar Charts](#stacked-bar-chart)
* [Radar Charts](#radar-chart)
* [Flagpole Diagrams](#flagpole-diagram)

These visualizations were chosen after conducting a quantitative content analysis on all the visualizations from papers in the [Neotoma Citations Google Scholar page](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=idoixqkAAAAJ&hl=en). The analysis provided insight into extant visualization methods in the field of paleoecology and informed selection of the particular examples included in the suite. The visualizations are created using [D3](https://github.com/d3/d3), a JavaScript library for interactive data visualization, and native [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/) icon functions. 

### Petal Plot

*Screenshot of Petal Plot*

A **petal plot** contains *n* custom icons rotated around a single location, where *n* is the number of variables in the data shown. The base of each icon located at the same latitude and longitude and each icon is rotated 360/*n* degrees. It uses color and size to encode nominal and numerical data, respectively. The orientation of each symbol also is used to encode the nominal value. Each color (in this example) is associated with a distinct taxon of pollen found at that site and is sized according to its value.

### Stacked Bar Chart

*Screenshot of Stacked Bar Chart*

A **stacked bar chart** depicts proportionally sized bars on top of each other, with the base of the stack centered at the latitude and longitude of the site. It uses color and size to encode nominal and numerical data, respectively. 

### Radar Chart

*Screenshot of Radar Chart*

A **radar chart** has a polygon with *n* vertices along equi-angular axes, where *n* is the number of variables in the data shown. Each vertex and axis correspond to a single variable. The distance a particular vertex is displaced along the axis from the center of the chart is proportional to the value for that particular variable. Each chart is centered at the latitude and longitude of the site.


### Flagpole Diagram

*Screenshot of Flagpole Diagram*

A **flagpole diagram** is a stacked area chart that is rotated 90 degrees, depicting time on the y-axis and value on the x-axis. The base of the graph is centered at the latitude and longitude of the site. It uses color and size to encode nominal and numerical data, respectively. 

## Exploring the Data

### What?

<img align="left">

The FCVS utilizes the [Neotoma Database](https://www.neotomadb.org/) to bring vast multivariate paleoecological datasets into a concise mobile interface. While currently set up to access a certain number of pollen taxa, the framework will be able to handle most data in the database.

More information on the Neotoma database can be found [here](https://www.neotomadb.org/about/category/database).

### Where?

The user first defines an area on the map he or she wishes to explore. The latitude and longitude coordinates of the vertices are stored in WKT format and used to query the Neotoma API for data that lies within the defined polygon. 

Each visualization is attached to the coordinates of a site where the sample was collected. The SiteID, a number that act as the unique identifier for each site, can be retrieved by clicking/tapping on the icon.
